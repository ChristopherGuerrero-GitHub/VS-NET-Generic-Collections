# VS-NET-Generic-Collections

The solution to better performance and SAFETY data types is by using the GENERIC COLLECTION.
When you instantiate/create an Generic collection object you must replace the T with the data type
Therefore no need to add more code to cast or wonder what kind of data types are contained
in the collection when reading/outputting the data.
